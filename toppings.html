                        This one's definitely heavy, but whipped cream and sliced bananas on pancakes is to die for.</th>

                        any different than just putting butter and syrup on your pancakes, but your cakes won't get soggy. </th>

                        Often overlooked, but you can never go wrong putting a pancake on top of your pancakes. This can be <br/>
                    repeated indefinitely.</th>
